		<h2>About 3D Audio</h2>
		
		<a href="index.html">(back)</a>
		<br><br>
		In 2006, I moved from the depths of one of the most mathematical and far from experiments
		theory (string theory) to 3D audio, about 7 dimensions closer to reality.
		3D Audio is the art of mastering acoustic fields in three dimensions. 
		<br><br>
		In about one hundred years, we've gone from having no way of listening to recorded sounds,
		to mono, then to stereo, then to 6-channels systems (surround 5.1 you find in cinemas and home-cinemas).
		All these are attempts to recreate more convincing soundscapes. Brute force brought some companyies to proprose
		formats like 7.1, 9.1, 10.1, 13.1 and even 22.2, corresponding to 8, 10, 11, 14 and 24 channels, respectively.
		
		<br><br>
		To my taste, these new atempts are a step backwards rather than forward, as every increase in the number of channels
		increases considerably the complexity of recording, and specially, post-producing new soundtracks, thus limiting the
		time sound mixer can spend in creative decisions.
		<br><br>
		The true step forward is, in my humble opinion, to progressively <b>get rid of the concept of channel</b>. 
		<i>No-channels</i> is my preferred 3D-sound format. In a no-channels world, no-one ever needs to take a decision about something like 
		<i>the left channel</i> or the <i>top-left-middle channel</i>. Such a paradigm is based on a
		proper mathematical description and manipulation of 3D-soundfields. It is already here, and it works 
		beautifully. With subtle differences in meaning, it goes under the name of 'channel-free mixing' or 'object based mixing'.
		<br><br>
		We brought our grain of sand towards this dream when we creatd 
		the startup <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imm_sound">immSound</a>, 
		and we continue pursuing it after the acquisition by Dolby Labs in 2012. 
		Now, in the form of <a href="http://www.dolby.com/us/en/professional/technology/cinema/dolby-atmos.html">Dolby Atmos</a>,
		and in a much larger great team.
